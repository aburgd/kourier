Build a Mojave Express Courier!

## What is this?
Short, it's [this](https://github.com/aburgd/courier) but better and in Kotlin instead of Python.
And y'know, functional.

## Why do I have to give it a name? Why can't it give _me_ a name?
The only fake data generator I could find was [`moove-it/fakeit`](https://github.com/moove-it/fakeit) and it relies on an Android library that just refuses to cooperate with me. If you can find a fake data generator like [`lk-geimfari/mimesis`](https://github.com/lk-geimfari/mimesis) in Java or Kotlin, then submit a PR with the implementation or an issue with the library name and link to documentation/where to get it. 

## Why Kotlin?
'cause I'm so used to OOP that I tried to do it in Python and it just does not want to work out for me.

## Why not another OOP language like Java?
Sweeter-than-Pease's syntax for one, and for two, why would I do that when I get the job done in Kotlin while maintaining the JVM?

## Alright, how do I use this?
Open up your shell of choice, `clone` this thing, run some `maven package`, and `java -jar <path to kourier-0.1.0.jar>`.
From there, it's pretty self-explanatory.

## What does the `Valid` mean at the end of each set?
Let's you know that each set of SPECIAL attributes, Skills, and Traits is Valid.
... and I forgot to take those out.
