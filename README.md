[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aburgd/kourier.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aburgd/kourier)

Build a Mojave Express Courier!

## What is this?
Short, it's [this](https://github.com/aburgd/courier-deprec) but better and in Kotlin instead of Python.
And y'know, functional.

## Why Kotlin?
It's a fun language.

## Why not another OOP language like Java?
That sweet, sweet syntax, just on the JVM.

## Alright, how do I use this?
Open up your shell of choice, `clone` this thing, run some `maven package`, and `java -jar <path to kourier-0.1.0.jar>`.
From there, it's pretty self-explanatory.

## What does the `Valid` mean at the end of each set?
Let's you know that each set of SPECIAL attributes, Skills, and Traits is Valid.
... and I forgot to take those out.
